In general the usage instructions from ``project_timesheet_time_control`` apply with the following additions.

Via maintenance requests:

#. Go to *Maintenance > Maintenance > Maintenance Requests*.
#. If a request has a running timesheet line, it will display a *Stop* button.
#. Other requests that have enabled timesheets will display a *Start* button
   that will open the same wizard as the timesheet lines, duplicating task's
   last timesheet line.
#. You can see the same in list view.
#. Click on any existing request or create a new one.
#. You can see the same feature in the action buttons box.

Note: All the *Start/Resume/Stop* features are disabled if you don't belong to
the *Timesheets/User* group or if you are viewing a timesheet that belongs
to another user.
